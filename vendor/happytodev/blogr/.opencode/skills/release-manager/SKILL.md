description: Automate Blogr package releases: version bumping, CHANGELOG updates, tagging, and publishing to GitHub.
---

## When to use

Trigger phrases: "release", "tag a new version", "publish vX.Y.Z", "cut a release", "bump version".

## Workflow

### 0. Pre-flight check — all PRs must be merged

Before any release work, verify that no open PRs target `main`:

```bash
git fetch origin main
OPEN_PRS=$(gh pr list --base main --state open --json number,title --jq '.[] | "\(.number) \(.title)"')
```

If `$OPEN_PRS` is not empty, **abort immediately** and display:

```markdown
## ⛔ Release blocked — open PRs detected

The following PRs must be merged into `main` before releasing:

| # | Title |
|---|-------|
| 12 | feat: ... |
| 14 | fix: ... |

Options:
1. Merge them now (`gh pr merge <number> --squash`)
2. Cancel the release and come back later
```

**Do not proceed** until all open PRs targeting `main` are merged.
This ensures the release captures the intended changes and avoids
accidental version bumps with unmerged work.

---

### 1. Preview changes since the last release

- Run: `git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline --no-decorate`
- If no tags exist yet, use: `git log --oneline --no-decorate`
- Present the output to the user so they can see what changed before choosing a bump type

### 2. Determine the new version

- Read current version from `composer.json` (`"version": "0.x.y"`)
- Ask user for bump type: `patch`, `minor`, `major`, or an explicit version like `0.19.0`
- **Compute the new version using semver rules correctly**:

  | Current | patch (Z+1) | minor (Y+1, Z=0) | major (X+1, Y=Z=0) |
  |---------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
  | `0.22.0` | `0.22.1` | `0.23.0` | `1.0.0` |
  | `0.22.5` | `0.22.6` | `0.23.0` | `1.0.0` |
  | `1.0.0` | `1.0.1` | `1.1.0` | `2.0.0` |

  ⚠️ **Common mistake**: patch is NOT `0.22.0 → 0.23.0` — that is a minor bump. Patch only increments the last digit.

- Present the computed version to the user for confirmation

### 3. Organize uncommitted changes into feature-grouped commits

- Run `git status --short` to list changed/new files
- **If there are no uncommitted changes**, skip this step
- **If there are uncommitted changes**, group files by feature area using path heuristics:

  | Pattern | Suggested commit message |
  |---|---|
  | `src/Services/LocaleService*`, `src/Traits/ClearsLocaleCache*`, `src/Helpers/LocaleHelper*`, view composer changes, route pattern changes in provider | `feat: locale auto-detection with cache invalidation` |
  | `config/blogr.php` (disabled keys), `CmsPageController*`, `src/Models/CmsPage*` (availableLocales) | `feat: disabled locales return 404 on frontend` |
  | `src/Filament/Pages/BlogrSettings*` | `feat: redesign multilingual settings UI` |
  | `src/Filament/Resources/CmsPage*`, `CmsBlockBuilder*` (non-import/export) | `feat: per-translation CMS page editing` |
  | `resources/views/components/*` (flag emojis) | `feat: flag emojis in navigation and language-switcher` |
  | `resources/views/cms/pages/*`, `resources/views/layouts/*` | `feat: CMS content rendering` |
  | `src/Commands/*Import*` | `fix: CLI import delegates to CmsPageImportExportService` |
  | `INSTALL.md`, `storage/app/blogr-exports/*` | `docs: install guide and install page translations` |
  | `tests/*` | `test: add tests for new features` (attach to relevant feature commit if possible, otherwise a single test commit) |

- **Heuristics**:
  - Files matching multiple patterns go with the *first* matching feature group
  - Config-only changes to keys unrelated to above → `chore: update config`
  - Dependabot / lockfile changes → `chore(deps): update dependencies`
- For each group, stage and commit:
  ```bash
  git add <file1> <file2> ...
  git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"
  ```

### 4. Generate and present release notes

- Use the commit log from step 1 to format as markdown with conventional commit categories (Features, Bug Fixes, Dependencies, etc.)
- **First output the full release notes as a text message** (not inside a question tool) so the user sees them. Use a markdown code block.
- **Then ask for approval** using the `question` tool with a simple question like "Do you approve these release notes?" and options ["Yes, proceed", "No, cancel"].
- **Do NOT put the release notes inside the question's description field** — the tool does not display long markdown content reliably.
- Include a "Cancel" option in case the user wants to abort.
- Only proceed when the user explicitly approves.

### 5. Run tests (ZERO TOLERANCE)

- Run: `vendor/bin/pest --parallel` (takes 4-5s)
- **Do NOT pipe through grep/tail/head — capture the raw output.** The last lines show the result:
  ```
  Tests:    56 skipped, 911 passed (2720 assertions)
  ```
- **If ANY test fails (even 1), abort immediately.** Do not proceed, do not commit, do not push.
- Zero tolerance: "skipped" and "passed" are OK; "failed" or "ERROR" means STOP.
- Report the failure count to the user and tell them what tests failed.

### 6. Update version files (atomic commit)

- **`composer.json`**: Edit the `"version"` field
- **`src/Blogr.php`**: Edit `const VERSION = '...'`
- **Commit** these two changes atomically:
  ```bash
  git add composer.json src/Blogr.php
  git commit -m "chore: bump version to v{version}"
  ```

### 7. Update CHANGELOG.md (atomic commit)

- Prepend a new entry at the top following the existing format:

  ```markdown
  ## [v{version}](https://github.com/happytodev/blogr/compare/v{version}...v{previous}) - {date}

  ### ✨ Features (or 🐛 Bug Fixes | ⬆️ Dependencies)

  - **{title}**: {description}
  ```

- Use the user-approved release notes content from step 4
- Keep existing entries intact
- **Commit** only CHANGELOG.md:
  ```bash
  git add CHANGELOG.md
  git commit -m "docs(changelog): v{version}"
  ```

### 8. Sync with remote before tagging

- **Critical**: Run `git fetch origin main` to get the latest remote state.
- Verify that your local `main` matches `origin/main`:
  ```bash
  if [ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" != "$(git rev-parse origin/main)" ]; then
      echo "⚠️  Local and remote main diverge. Run 'git pull --rebase origin main' first."
      exit 1
  fi
  ```
- If they diverge, run `git pull --rebase origin main` and `git push origin main` before proceeding.
- Check that the tag does not already exist locally or remotely:
  ```bash
  if git tag -l "v{version}" | grep -q . || git ls-remote --tags origin "refs/tags/v{version}" | grep -q .; then
      echo "⚠️  Tag v{version} already exists. Create a new patch version instead."
      exit 1
  fi
  ```
- **⚠️  NEVER re-tag a version that has already been pushed.** Once a tag is published, it is immutable for Packagist. If you need to fix a tag, bump to a new patch version.

### 9. Push main first, then tag

```bash
git push origin main
git tag v{version}
# Verify tag points to HEAD:
if [ "$(git rev-parse v{version})" != "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Tag does not match HEAD. Delete and re-tag."
    git tag -d v{version}
    exit 1
fi
git push origin v{version}
```

➡ **Push `main` BEFORE creating the tag.** This prevents the tag from pointing to a stale commit after a rebase.

### 10. Create GitHub Release

- Set `RELEASE_NOTES` to the *exact markdown* the user approved in step 4 (the body of the CHANGELOG entry, without the heading/date line)
- Run: `gh release create v{version} --title "v{version}" --notes "$RELEASE_NOTES"`

### 11. Confirm

- Inform the user the release was published with the URL and commit hash
